# algorithm #

Hi, welcome. This repository contain different kinda of algorithm I made.

- [overlap](/overlap)
- [apc](/apc)

## Overlap ##

Algorithm is designed for solving overlap question for two file. This took idea of sorting algorithm but way more than it. Hard part of this algorithm is which type of data structure is appropriate for generating correct output. This matter a lot for overall performance of algorithm. Here is the [test](/overlap/test.md) for different type of data structure.   

Here is the outcome for different program based on this algorithm.
+ [The fastest way](/overlap/sweep.py) 
+ [algorithm on C.elegan](/overlap/C.elegan/sweepline.py)   
    + [output](C.elegan/sweepline)

## Apc ##~~~~

This stand for all possible combination. There is one readme under the apc folder that include everything we need for understanding two solution for the whole algorithm. This problem is basically finding all possible isoforms with given gene.
