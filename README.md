# overlap #

Hi, welcome. This algorithm is designed for solving overlap question for two file.  
Hard part of this algorithm is which type of data structure is appropriate for generating correct output.   

Here is the [test](test.md) for different type of data structure.  

Here is the outcome for different program based on this algorithm.
+ [The fastest way](sweep.py) 
+ [The most fancy output](sweep2.py)
+ [algorithm on C.elegan](C.elegan/sweepline.py)   
    + [output](C.elegan/sweepline)
