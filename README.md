# algorithm #

Hi, welcome. This reprocitory contain differents kinda of algorithm I made.

- [overlap](/overlap)
- [apc](/apc)

## Overlap ##

Algorithm is designed for solving overlap question for two file.   
This tooks idea of sorting algorithm but way more than it.   
Hard part of this algorithm is which type of data structure is appropriate for generating correct output.   
This matter a lot for overall performance of algorithm.   
Here is the [test](/overlap/test.md) for different type of data structure.   

Here is the outcome for different program based on this algorithm.
+ [The fastest way](/overlap/sweep.py) 
+ [algorithm on C.elegan](/overlap/C.elegan/sweepline.py)   
    + [output](C.elegan/sweepline)

## Apc ##

This stand for all possible combination.
