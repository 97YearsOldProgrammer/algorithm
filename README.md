# algorithm #

Hi, welcome. This reprocitory contain differents kinda of algorithm I made.

## Overlap ##
algorithm is designed for solving overlap question for two file.  
Hard part of this algorithm is which type of data structure is appropriate for generating correct output.   

Here is the [test](/overlap/test.md) for different type of data structure.  

Here is the outcome for different program based on this algorithm.
+ [The fastest way](/overlap/sweep.py) 
+ [The most fancy output](/overlap/sweep2.py)
+ [algorithm on C.elegan](C.elegan/sweepline.py)   
    + [output](C.elegan/sweepline)
